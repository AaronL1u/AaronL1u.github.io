Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed. Then run:

```shell
bundle
```

Run this to deploy locally.
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

For Mac M1 / M2, run this may help.

```shell
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
```
