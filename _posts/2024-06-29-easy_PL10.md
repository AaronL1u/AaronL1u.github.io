## Algebras, Signatures and Terms

### Algebras

An algebra consists of one or more sets, called **carriers**, together with a collection of distinguished elements and **first-order** (or **algebraic**) **functions**.

$$f:A_1 \times ... \times A_k \rightarrow A$$

over carriers of the algebra.

> **First-order** or **algebraic** simply means that the function cannot accept functions as parameters.
