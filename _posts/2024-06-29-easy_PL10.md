In preceding articles, we considered **functional** programs that do not contain assignment or other operations that change the values of identifiers. In computer science, of course, it is more common to use **imperative** programs. A typical example of imperative construct is the assignment statement $x:=y$, which sets the value of $x$ to the value $y$. 

In this article, we will introduce the simple imperative language of so-called $\text{while}$ programs.

## While Programs

### L-values and R-values

One basic property of C-like languages is that assignable variables have two kinds of "values." These have traditionally been called **L-values** and **R-values**. They correpsond to occurrences on the left and right hand side of an assignment statememt.

In elementary terms, the **L-value** of a variable is its location in memory and the **R-value** is the contents of this location.

To see the reason to raise this concept, let us consider the assignment statement $x:=y+3$. A compiler for a register-based machine might compile this statement into the following instructions:

1. Put the **contents of location** $y$ in register $a$.
2. Add $3$ to register $a$.
3. Store the contents of register $a$ in **location** $x$.

It is easy to see from this "compiled code" that the occurrence of $y$ on the right hand of the assignment refers to the **contents of a location**, while the occurrence of $x$ on the left refers to the **location** itself. 

Another way of saying this is that the assignment $x:=y'+3$ will have the same effect as $x:=y+3$ if the contents of $y'$ is the same as $y$, but $x':=y+3$ will have the same effect as $x:=y+3$ only if $x'$ names the same location of $x$.

In general, the type of the L-value of a variable is different from the type of its R-value — the L-value is a location, while the R-value may be an integer or other storable value.

In giving denotational semantics to programs, it is necessary to distinguish between L-values and R-values. This is not overly difficult, but it leads to slight technical complication since the distinction relies on context.

As a simplifying assumption, we will use a version of $\text{while}$ programs in which the distinction between L-values and R-values is explicit. Specifically, we will use variables of type $loc$ for assignable variables, and apply a contents function $cont$ to a location to extracts its contents.

> This is similar to the way pointer variables are used in C, for example, where we write $\ast x$ for the contents of $x$.  
This is also the way all variables are treated in the programming language ML, which does not seem to suffer from this approach. In fact, explicit location expressions in ML provides some useful flexibility.

### Syntax of While Programs

For simplicity, we assume we are only interested in values of two basic types, $val$ and $bool$, and only elements of type $val$ may be stored.

> In writing examples, it is helpful to regard $val$ as $nat$, and assume common numeric and boolean operations. However, when we analyze  the logic for reasoning about $\text{while}$ programs, it will be useful to consider different semantic interpretations of $val$, and arbitrary algebraic functions over $val$ and $bool$.

Let $\Sigma$ be an algebraic signature over basic type $val$ and $bool$, and let us assume the function symbol

$$cont:loc \to val$$

is distinct from the function symbols of $\Sigma$. It is a function that maps L-values to R-values.

To simplify syntactic considerations, let us choose some infinite sets $\Gamma_{loc}$, $\Gamma_{val}$ and $\Gamma_{bool}$ of types $loc$, $val$ and $bool$, respectively, and use these throughout our discussion of $\text{while}$ program.

Using algebraic terms of types $val$ and $bool$ over $\Sigma$ and function symbol $const$, we define the language of $\text{while}$ programs by

$$P \quad ::= \quad x:= M \mid P;\:P \mid \text{if } B \text{ then } P \text{ else } P \mid \text{while } B \text{ do } P \text{ od}$$

where we assume that variable $x$ has type $loc$, expression $M$ has type $val$ and $B$ has type $bool$. And we allow arbitrary operations on $val$ and $bool$, such as $+$, $-$, $<$, and so on.

As an example, using this signature, we may write the logarithm program as the following.

$$x:=1 ;\: y:=0 ;\: \text{while } \: cont \: x < cont \: z \: \text{ do } \: x := cont \: x +  cont \: x ; \: y := cont \: y +  1 \:\text{ od}$$

We may think of this program as having input $z$ and output $y$. This program uses a "scratch" variable $x$ to set $y$ to an integer approximation of the logarithm of any $z>0$. For easier understanding, we also put an equivalent C program here.

```c
int logarithm(int z) {
    while (x < z) {
        x = x + x;
        y = y + 1;
    }
    return y;
}
```
