In this article, we will present a language for **Programming Computable Functions** called **PCF**. This is a typed functional language based on lambda calculus, and is originally formulated by Dana Scott in this [manuscript](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Scott93.pdf). The language is designed to be easily analyzed, rather than as a practical language to be used in normal days.

Our main goals are to develop a feel for the programming capabilities of lambda calculus-based languages and summarize general properties and techniques that apply to a variety of languages. We will use lambda calculus to prove both positive and negative results about the expressiveness of PCF.

## Syntax of PCF

### Types Overview

We start the introduction of PCF from listing all the types of this language. 

Every expression of PCF has a unique type. The basic values are natural numbers and booleans (truth value $true$ and $false$), which have types $$nat$$ and $$bool$$, respectively.

PCF also has pairs, belonging to cartesian product types, and functions, belonging to function types. The PCF notation for the cartesian product of types $\sigma$ and $\tau$ is $\sigma \times \tau$. For example, the type of natural number pairs is written $nat \times nat$. The type of a function with domain $\sigma$ and range $\tau$ is written $\sigma \rightarrow \tau$.

One property of PCF is that only expressions that satisfy certain typing constraints are actually considered part of the language. For example, although PCF has addition, the expression $true + 1$ is not considered well formed. (It does not make sense to add a truth value to a natural number!) With variables, the typing conditions depend on the context in which an expression is used. For example, $x+5$ only makes sense if the variable $x$ is declared to have type $nat$.

### Object Language and Meta-Language

When we study a language, we need to distinguish the language we study from the language we use to describe this language and its meaning.

The language we study is traditionlly called **object language**, since this is the object of our attention. The language we use to describe the object language is called **meta-language**, because it transcends the object language in some way.

During our study of PCF, symbols and expressions of PDF belong to the object language because PCF is the object of study. Besides, it is convenient to use additional symbols to stand for arbitrary symbols and expressions of the object language. These are said to be symbols of the meta-language, the language we use for the study purpose.

By tradition, we use letters $x,y,z,...$ (including $x', x_1$) as meta-variables for arbitrary variables of PCF, and letters  $M,N,P,...$ (including $M', M_1$) as meta-variables for expressions of PCF. 

It is possible for two meta-variables, say $x$ and $y$, to stand for the same object variable. We use the symbol $\equiv$ for syntactic equality of object expressions. Namely, we write $x \equiv y$ if $x$ and $y$ stand for the same variable of PCF and  $x \not\equiv y$ if they are distinct variables.


### Booleans and Natural Numbers

$$
\begin{split}
\langle bool\_exp \rangle ::= &\langle bool\_var\rangle \mid true \mid false \mid Eq ? \: \langle nat\_exp \rangle \: \langle nat\_exp \rangle \mid \\
&\text{if } \langle bool\_exp \rangle \text{ then } \langle bool\_exp \rangle \text{ else } \langle bool\_exp \rangle
\end{split}
$$
