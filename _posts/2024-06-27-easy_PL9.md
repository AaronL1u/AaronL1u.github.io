For most logical systems, a **model** provides a mechanism for giving mathematical meaning to each well-formed expression, in sufficient detail to determine whether any formula of the logic is true. For logic with variables, it is common to separate the assignment of values to variables from the general notion of model.

For example, an algebra provides a set of possible values for each variable and an interpretation for each function symbol. After choosing values for variables (by selecting an *environment*), we use the functions given by the algebra to determine the value of an algebra term. Doing this for two terms, we may determine whether an equation between algebra terms hold.

In a model for typed lambda calculus, we require a set of possible values for each variable and an interpretation for each constant symbol that appears in the signature. This means that we need a set of values for each type, and a specific one of these chosen for each constant symbol.

However, that is not all. We have to make sense of application and lambda abstraction. More specifically, suppose $A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ is the set of values of type $\sigma \to \tau$, and $A^{\sigma}$ is similarly the set of values of type $\sigma$. If $f \in A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ and $x \in A^{\sigma}$, then we need to be able to apply $f$ to $x$.

The simplest condition on models that would make this possible is to require that $A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ be a set of functions from $A^{\sigma}$ to $A^{\tau}$. The ordinary function application would give us $f(x)$ in the set of values for type $\tau$.

A subtle issue here is that we also need to be able to interpret every lambda abstraction, which means that every lambda-definable function will exist must lie in the appropriate set of values. If we impose the stronger requirement that $A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ must be a set of **all** functions from $A^{\sigma}$ to $A^{\tau}$, then certainly every lambda-definable function will exist in the model, and we can interpret every well-typed lambda term as a value in the correct set.

What makes the model theroy of typed lambda calculus complicated is that we need to be relatively flexible about the interpretation of function types. We cannot simply say that in any model $\mathcal{A}$, $A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ must be the set of all functions from $A^{\sigma}$ to $A^{\tau}$. The main reason is that we need to be able to interpret constants such as $fix$, whose equational axiom forces every function to have a fixed point. If $A^\sigma$ has more than one element, then there exists at least one function on $A^\sigma$ without a fixed point. Therefore, if we force $A^{\sigma}$ to $A^{\tau}$ to contain all functions, we cannot have models for PCF, or any other typed lambda theory involving fixed points. This requires us to define models using a more flexible, and more abstract, condition on function spaces.

There are several equivalent definitions of "general models," which we will call **Henkin models** after [*Completeness in the theory of types*, L Henkin]({{ site.url }}/download/PL/Henkin.pdf). The definition we use has three parts. We first define typed applicative structures, and then specify two additional conditions that applicative structures must have to be models.
