This article documents sentence mistaks that non-native English speakers tend to make when writing academic English.

# Spelling

## Plurals

The word "data" is plural, not singular.  

## Possessives

Inanimate nouns — except for references to time — rarely take the possessive form.

> `a day's length` but not `the house's door`  
> `the performance of the tool` but not `the tool's performance`
