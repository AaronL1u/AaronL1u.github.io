From this article on, we start to present the pure simply-typed lambda calculus. PCF is extended from this system by adding natural numbers, booleans and fixed-point operators.

In previous articles, we use PCF to describe the connections between typed lambda calculus and programming in some detail. Now we are more concerned with mathematical properties of the system.

Church developed lambda calculus in the 1930's as part of a formal logic and as a formalism for defining computable functions. The original logic, which was untyped, was intended to serve a foundational role in the formalization of mathematics. Using lambda abstraction, logical quantifiers (such as universal, $\forall$, and existential, $\exist$, quantifiers) may be treated as constants, in much the same way that recursive function definitions may be treated using fixed-point constants.

In 1936, Kleene proved that the natural number functions definable in untyped lambda calculus are exactly the recursive functions. Turing, in 1937, then proved that the $\lambda$-definable numeric functions are exactly the functions computable by Turing machines. Together, these results, which are analogous to properties of PCF discussed in [Easy Foundations for Programming Languages V — PCF Iteration and Recursion]({{site.url}}/posts/easy_PL5/), establish connections between lambda calculus and other models of computation.

After the development of electronic computers, untyped lambda calculus clearly influenced the development of Lisp in the late 1950's. General connections between lambda notation and other programming languages were elaborated throughout 1960's by various researchers, leading to the view that the semantics of programming languages could be given using extensions of lambda calculus.

## Types

We will use the phrase **"simply-typed lambda calculus"** to refer to any version of typed lambda calculus.
