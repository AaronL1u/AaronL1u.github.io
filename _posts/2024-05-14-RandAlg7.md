In computer science, **fingerprinting** is a procedure that maps an arbitrarily large data item (such as a computer file) to a much shorter bit string, its fingerprint, that uniquely identifies the original data.

In this article, we will discuss a simple fingerprinting algorithm, and introduce a variant of it to solve the pattern matching problem.

## Fingerprinting Algorithm

Suppose there are two people in the communication — Alice and Bob. They want to make sure that their respective data is the same.

Formally put, Alice has an $$n$$-bit number $$x = x_1x_2...x_n$$. Bob also has an $$n$$-bit number $$y = y_1y_2...y_n$$. Their goal is to check if $$x=y$$ or not effciently, in the sense of low communication complexity.

Below is a simple fingerprinting algorithm.

> The notation $$\text{mod}$$ represents the **modulo** operation. Given two positive numbers $$x$$ and $$p$$, $$x \text{ mod } p$$ is the remainder of the [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) of $$p$$ by $$x$$.  
For example, the expression "5 mod 2" evaluates to 1, and "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0.

Observe that if $$x=y$$, then $$F_p(x) = F_p(y)$$ for any choice of $$p$$, and Algorithm 1 outputs Yes always.

But if $$x \neq y$$, we have to show that $$ \Pr(F_p(x) \neq F_p(y)) \geq 1/2 $$ for a suitable choice of $$T$$.

Here comes a key lemma. (proof is at the [end](#proof) of this article.)

**(Lemma)** Suppose $$T = 8n$$. If $$x \neq y$$, then 

$$\Pr(F_p(x) = F_p(y)) \leq \frac{1}{2}.$$

So, by the above lemma, we choose $$T = O(n)$$, then $$p$$ and $$F_p(x)$$ have $$\log{n}$$ bits. Therefore, in Algorithm 1, Alice only needs to send $$O(\log{n})$$ bits to Bob.

> The idea in our fingerprinting algorithm can be used to improve the [polynomial identity testing algorithm]({{site.url}}/posts/RandAlg5/#randomized-algorithm-for-pit). Sometimes evaluating polynomials may result in huge numbers during calculation. In this case, we can use modulo a small prime number as in fingerprinting to reduce computational cost.

## Pattern Matching

Given an $$n$$-bit string $$x=x_1...x_n$$ and a **shorter** $$m$$-bit string $$y=y_1...y_n$$ where $$m \leq n$$, check if $$y$$ occurs as a substring of $$x$$ or not. In other words, for each $$j$$ let $$w(j)=x_j x_{j+1}...x_{j-m+1}$$, and we want to check if there exists $$j$$ such that $$w(j) = y$$.

This is just a slightly modified version of the fingerprinting algorithm. To ensure this algorithm output No when $$y$$ is not a substring of $$x$$ with probability as least $$1/2$$, $$T$$ should be set as $$8mn$$. (Proof omitted.)

In the end, let's consider the running time of this algorithm.

Since $$T = O(mn)$$, the prime $$p$$ has $$O(\log{mn}) = O(\log{n})$$ bits. Computing $$F_p(y)$$ takes $$O(m)$$ time since $$y$$ has $$m$$ bits. Computing $$F_p(w(j))$$ for all $$j$$ can be done recursively:

$$ 
\begin{split}
 w(j+1) &= 2w(j) + x_{j+m} - 2^mx_j \\
\Longrightarrow \quad  F_p(w(j+1)) &= (2 F_p(w(j)) + x_{j+m} - F_p(2^m)x_j) \text{ mod } p
\end{split}
$$

As a result, each iteration takes $$O(1)$$ time (note that we can compute $$F_p(2^m) = (2^m \text{ mod } p)$$ once for all). The total running time is $$O(n + m)$$.
 
## Proof

In this section, we try to prove the lemma in the [first section](#fingerprinting-algorithm).

Here we need some knowledge of number theory to establish this lemma.

**Prime Number Theorem:**

- Let $$\pi(x)$$ be the number of prime numbers less than or equal to $$x$$. Then it holds

  $$ \pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\ln{x}}. $$

  > The notation $$f \sim g$$ means two functions are **comparable**. Namely, $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1$$.
  {: .prompt-tip }

  Moreover, for $$x \geq 17$$, it holds

  $$ \frac{x}{\ln{x}} \leq \pi(x) \leq  \frac{1.26x}{\ln{x}}. $$

- Let $$p_n$$ be the $$n$$th prime number. Then it holds

  $$ p_n \sim n \ln{n}. $$

- Let $$p$$ denote prime numbers in the equation below, and it holds

  $$ \sum_{p\leq x} \ln{p} = \ln{\prod_{p \leq x}p} \sim x.  $$

The lemma we want to prove says if $$T = 8n$$ and $$x \neq y$$, then

$$\Pr(F_p(x) = F_p(y)) \leq \frac{1}{2}.$$

Observe that, $$F_p(x) = F_p(y)$$ if and only if $$p \mid \lvert x-y \rvert$$.

> The symbol $$m \mid n$$ means "$$m$$ divides $$n$$"; and $$m \nmid n$$ is its "not" version. For example, $$2 \mid 10$$, but $$3 \nmid 10$$. See this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor) for more information.

We need to count the number of primes that divides $$\lvert x-y \rvert$$, and we denote this count by $$k$$.

Consider $$\lvert x-y \rvert$$ has at most $$n$$ bits, by the Prime Number Theorem, we can deduce $$p_k \leq n$$ from

$$2^n \geq |x-y| \geq p_1...p_k \gtrsim e^{p_k} \geq 2^{p_k}.$$

Notice that $$p_k \leq n$$ is equivalent to $$\pi(n) \geq k$$.

Therefore, we deduce again from the Prime Number Theorem that

$$ \Pr(F_p(x) = F_p(y)) \leq \frac{\pi(n)}{\pi(T)} \leq \frac{2n/\log{n}}{T/\log{T}} = \frac{2n}{T} \cdot \frac{\log{T}}{\log{n}} \leq \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2},$$

as wanted.
