In computer science, **fingerprinting** is a procedure that maps an arbitrarily large data item (such as a computer file) to a much shorter bit string, its fingerprint, that uniquely identifies the original data.

## Fingerprinting Algorithm

Alice has an $$n$$-bit number $$x = x_1x_2...x_n$$. Bob also has an $$n$$-bit number $$y = y_1y_2...y_n$$. Their goal is to check if $$x=y$$ or not effciently, in the sense of low communication complexity.

Below is a simple fingerprinting algorithm.

Observe that if $$x=y$$, then $$F_p(x) = F_p(y)$$ for any choice of $$p$$, and Algorithm 1 outputs Yes always.

But if $$x \neq y$$, we have to show that $$ \Pr(F_p(x) \neq F_p(y)) \geq 1/2 $$ for a suitable choice of $$T$$.

Here comes a key lemma. (proof is at the [end](#proof) of this article.)

**(Lemma)** Suppose $$T = 8n$$. If $$x \neq y$$, then 

$$\Pr(F_p(x) = F_p(y)) \leq \frac{1}{2}.$$

So, by the above lemma, we choose $$T = O(n)$$, then $$p$$ and $$F_p(x)$$ have $$\log{n}$$ bits. Therefore, in Algorithm 1, Alice only needs to send $$O(\log{n})$$ bits to Bob.

> The idea in our fingerprinting algorithm can be used to improve the [polynomial identity testing algorithm]({{site.url}}/posts/RandAlg5/#randomized-algorithm-for-pit). Sometimes evaluating polynomials may result in huge numbers during calculation. In this case, we can use modulo a small prime number as in fingerprinting to reduce computational cost.

## Pattern Matching

Given an $$n$$-bit string $$x=x_1...x_n$$ and a **shorter** $$m$$-bit string $$y=y_1...y_n$$ where $$m \leq n$$, check if $$y$$ occurs as a substring of $$x$$ or not. In other words, for each $$j$$ let $$w(j)=x_j x_{j+1}...x_{j-m+1}$$, and we want to check if there exists $$j$$ such that $$w(j) = y$$.

## Proof

> This section is optional to read.
{: .prompt-info }

In this section, we try to prove the lemma in the [first section](#fingerprinting-algorithm).

Here we need some knowledge of number theory to establish this lemma.

**Prime Number Theorem:**

- Let $$\pi(x)$$ be the number of prime numbers less than or equal to $$x$$. Then it holds

  $$ \pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\ln{x}}. $$

  > The notation $$f \sim g$$ means two functions are **comparable**. Namely, $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1$$.

  Moreover, for $$x \geq 17$$, it holds

  $$ \frac{x}{\ln{x}} \leq \pi(x) \leq  \frac{1.26x}{\ln{x}}. $$

- Let $$p_n$$ be the $$n$$th prime number. Then it holds

  $$ p_n \sim n \ln{n}. $$

- Let $$p$$ denote prime numbers in the equation below, and it holds

  $$ \sum_{p\leq x} \ln{p} = \ln{\prod_{p \leq x}p} \sim x.  $$
