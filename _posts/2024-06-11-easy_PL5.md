In the last two sections, we compare the natural-number functions definable in PCF with the classes of total and partial recursive functions. The main results are all recursive total and partial functions on the natural numbers are definable in PCF. Using Turing machines can construct a similar proof.

## Iteration and Tail Recursion

Many algorithms, when written in an imperative language like C, use the following pattern of iteration.

```c
Initialize;
while (! Done) {
	Stmt;   // Statements
}
```

> In the section "Initialize" before the while loop, we may need to declare and initialize the value some variables that will be used in the loop.
{: .prompt-tip}

If the sections "Initialize" and "Stmt" only change the values of a fixed, finite set of variables, and "Done" is a side-effect-free test depending on the values of these variables, then we may easily transform a program segment of this form into a functional program.

Let us assume for simplicity that there is only one variable involved. There is no loss of generality because we can replace a finite set of variables by a record containing their values.

To put this in the context of PCF, suppose we have PCF expressions

$$
\begin{split}
&init:\sigma\\
&next:\sigma \rightarrow \sigma\\
&done:\sigma \rightarrow bool\\
\end{split}
$$

The first expression $init$ is the variable declared in the section "Initialize". The second expression $next$ is the function that updates the value of $init$ as what have done in section "Stmt". And the third expression $done$ is the function that outputs boolean based on the value of $init$. So that the iteration could be written as the following C program using an additional variable $x$.

```c
int x = init;  // suppose init is of type int
while (! done(x)) {
	x = next(x);
}
```

And this can be transformed into the recursion format with an additional function $f$ as follows.

```c
int f(int x) {
	if (done(x)) return x;
	else return f(next(x));
}
int x = f(init);
```

We can do something similar in PCF by defining the expression $$ loop\: init \: next \: done $$ by

$$ 
\begin{split}
loop\: init \: next \: done \:\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\: &\text{ letrec } f(x:\sigma) = \text{ if } (done \: x) \text{ then } x \text{ else } f \: (next \: x) \\
&\text{ in } (f \: init) 
\end{split}
$$

> For easier understanding, you can think of $loop$ as a function that accepts three parameters: $init$, $next$, and $done$.
{: .prompt-tip}

If we write $$next^n \:x$$ for the result $$next\:(next\:(...(next\:x)...))$$ of applying $next$ to $x$ a total of $n$ times, we have the following proposition.

**(Proposition.)** If $$done \: (next^i \: init) \twoheadrightarrow false$$ for all $i < n$ and $$done \: (next^n \: init) \twoheadrightarrow true$$, then

$$loop\: init \: next \: done \twoheadrightarrow next^n \: init$$

The translation of iterative loops into recursive functions always produces a recursive function with a particular form. A recursive function with a definition of the form

$$ f(x) = \text{ if } B \text{ then } M \text{ else } f(N) ,$$

where neither $B$, $M$ nor $N$ contains $f$, is called a **tail-recursive function**.

In many modern languages, tail-recursive functions are often recognized by the compiler. This type of recursion will be compiled into efficient iterative code that does not require a new stack frame for each recursion call.


## Total Recursive Functions

A commonly accepted belief, called **Church's thesis**, is that every numeric function that is computable by any practical computer is recursive. This thesis was formulated in the 1930's, before electronic computers, during a period when mathematicians were actively investigating the possibility and impossibiliy of solving problems by systematic algorithms.

One reason for believing Church's thesis is that all of the formalisms for defining computable functions that were proposed in 1930's, and since, give rise to the same set of functions on the natural numbers. The early formalisms include the recursive functions, Turing machines, and lambda calculus. It follows from Church's thesis (although there is no way to prove something rigorously), that every partial or total function definable in PCF is recursive. And this gives evidence that every computable function on natural numbers is definable in PCF. In other words, as least for natural-number functions, PCF is a "universal" programming language. Besides, relying on undeciable properties of recursive functions, we can obtain interesting undecidability properties of PCF.

> Church's thesis has the limitation for function on types other than natural numbers. For basic data such as booleans, strings, or arrays of such data, it makes sense to think of the computable functions as precisely those functions we can compute when we code each boolean, string or array by a natural number. By this reasoning, we can see that any programming language that lets us associate natural numbers with its basic data types, and compute all recursive functions on the natural numbers, is "universal" for defining computable functions on all the basic data types.  
However, for "infinite" values, such as functions, the issue is not as clear cut. In particular, mathematical logicians have identified several distinct classes of "computable functions on the natural-number functions" and have not been able to prove that these are identical.

We begin with the simple case of total functions. Since we have pairing in PCF, we will consider total recursive functions of more than one argument. A function $f$ is **numeric** if $f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ for some $k > 0$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of numeric functions, we say $\mathcal{C}$ is

- **Closed under composition** if, for every $f_1,...,f_l:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g:\mathbb{N}^l \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ from $\mathcal{C}$, the class $\mathcal{C}$ also contains the function $h$ defined by

$$h(n_1,...,n_k) = g(f_1(n1,...,n_k),...,f_l(n1,...,n_k)),$$

- **Closed under primitive recursion** if, for every $f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g:\mathbb{N}^{k+2} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ from $\mathcal{C}$, the class $\mathcal{C}$ contains the function $h$ defined by

$$ 
\begin{split}
h(0,n_1,...,n_k) &= f(n_1,...,n_k)\\
h(m+1,n_1,...,n_k) &= g(h(m,n_1,...,n_k),m,n_1,...,n_k),
\end{split}
$$

- **Closed under minimization** if, for every $f:\mathbb{N}^{k+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that $$\forall \: n_1,...,n_k\:.\:\exists \: m \:.\: f(m,n_1,...,n_k) = 0$$, the class $\mathcal{C}$ contains the function $g$ defined by

$$g(n_1,...,n_k) = \text{ the least } m \text{ such that } f(m, n_1,...,n_k) = 0.$$

The class $\mathcal{R}$ of **total recursive functions** is the least class of numeric functions that contains the projection functions $\mathbf{Proj}_i^k(n_1,...,n_k)=n_i$, the successor function $$\lambda x:nat.\:x+1$$, the constant zero function $$\lambda x:nat.\:0$$, and that is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and minimization.
> The projection operator $\mathbf{Proj}_i^k$ means "extracting the $i$-th one from $k$ elements."
{: .prompt-tip}

We can show that every total recursive function is definable in PCF. Formally put, for any natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let us write $\lceil n \rceil$ for the corresponding numeral of PCF. We say a numeric function $f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is **PCF-definable**, or simply **definable**, if there is a closed PCF expression $M:nat^k \rightarrow nat$, where $nat^k$ is the $k$-ary product type $nat \times ... \times nat$, such that

$$ 
\begin{split}
\\\forall \:n_1,...,n_k \in \mathbb{N}\:.\: M \: \langle  \lceil n_1 \rceil,...,\lceil n_k \rceil \rangle = \lceil f(n_1,...,n_k) \rceil.
\end{split}
$$

> For a natural number $n$, its corresponding **numeral** $\lceil n \rceil$ is the symbol we write down in a text editor as the part of PCF language.
{: .prompt-tip}

**(Theorem.)** Every total recursive function is definable in PCF.

**(Proof.)** To prove this, we must give the projection function $\mathbf{Proj}_i^k$, the successor function, and the constant zero function, and show closure under composition, primitive recursion, and minimization. Following our previous description, we let

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{Proj}_1^1 \:&\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\: \lambda x:nat.\:x\\
\mathbf{Proj}_1^k \:&\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\: \lambda x:nat^k.\:\mathbf{Proj}_1x \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad(1 < k) \\
\mathbf{Proj}_i^k \:&\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\: \lambda x:nat^k.\:\mathbf{Proj}_{i-1}^{k-1}(\mathbf{Proj}_2x)  \quad \quad (1 < i \leq k) \\
succ \:&\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\:\lambda x:nat.\:x+1\\
zero \:&\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\:\lambda x:nat.\:0\\
\end{split}
$$

If $f_1,...,f_l:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g:\mathbb{N}^l \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ are represented by the PCF terms $M_1,...,M_l$ and $N$, respectively, then the function $h$ defined by composition is represented by the term

$$\lambda x:nat^k .\: N \: \langle M_1\:x ,..., M_l\:x \rangle.$$

If $f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g:\mathbb{N}^{k+2} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ are represented by $M$ and $N$, then the function $h$ defined by primitive recursion is represented by

$$\lambda \langle x:nat,y:nat^k \rangle.\: prim \:(M \: y) \: (\lambda\langle m:nat,n:nat \rangle .\:N \:\langle m,\langle n,y \rangle \rangle) \: x,$$
