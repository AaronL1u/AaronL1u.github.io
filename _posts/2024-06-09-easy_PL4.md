In the last article, we have seen all of the structure of PCF, now we will take a step back and discuss the meaning, or **semantics**, in a general way. We want our discussion can be applied to a variety of programming languages.

The three forms of semantics we will consider are **axiomatic semantics**, given by a proof system, **operational semantics** arising from a set of reduction rules and **denotational semantics**. Each form of semantics has advantages and disadvantages for understanding properties of programs. In addition, there are standard connection between the three forms of semantics that should hold for any programming language. We will discuss them in this article.

## PCF Programs

In any programming language, not all well-formed syntactic entities can be executed or evaluated. Therefore, we distinguish **programs** from other syntactic forms that may be used only as parts of programs. A program has two characteristics: (1) a program should not refer to any undeclared or unbound variables; (2) and a program should have the appropriate type or form to yield a printable value or observable effect.

PCF has two syntactic categories: types and terms (expressions that have types). In PCF, we consider closed boolean and numeric expressions programs, because we can expect interpreter to directly print their values. But if we give an open natural number term such as $x+5$ to an interpreter, there is no correct value since the value to $x$ is not given.

In addition, we cannot expect the value of a function expression to be printed with the same degree of accuracy as a natural number or boolean. No interpreter can print function expressions in a way that would tell us exactly which mathematical function is defined by the function expression typed in. This is because, which we will explain in future articles, *equality for partial recursive function is undecidable and every partial recursive function is definable in PCF*. For this reason, we say that natural number and boolean values are **observable**, but $nat \rightarrow nat$ values are not.
