## Introduction

Randomness is a basic and extremely useful concept in algorithm design. Introducing randomness allows us to deal with some very hard questions. Although we cannot provide an accurate result for these hard ones, probablisitic techniques can help us to give a approximated result, and tell to what extent we can believe the given result is closed to the ground-truth.

An intuitive example is the matrix multiplication verification problem. The problem is described as follows: suppose there are three $$ n \times n $$ matrices $$ A,B,C $$ , we want to determine whether the multiplication of first two matrices equals the third one, i.e., $$ AB=C $$ . A straight-forward strategy is to first calculate the matrix multiplication and do the comparison, which depends on how fast we can multiply two $$ n \times n $$ matrices. Apparently, doing it directly requires $$ O(n^3) $$ time. (The current fastest algorithm for matrix multiplication runs in $$ O(n^{2.37...}) $$ time.) The question is, can we find a way to do this job more quickly?

The answer is yes. If we use the randomized algorithm, we only need $$ O(n^2) $$ time to do the matrix multiplication verification! 

Here we use an auxiliary n-dimentional vector $$ x $$ , and try to verify whether $$ ABx=Cx $$ . The reason in doing so is that calculate the multiplication of a matrix and a vector only need $$ O(n^2) $$ time! Notice that $$ (AB)x = A(Bx) $$, we can first calculate $$ Bx $$ and then multiply the result with $$ A $$. So, verifying $$ ABx=Cx $$ is much faster than verifying $$ AB=C $$ .

It is eazy to induce that if $$ AB=C $$ , then $$ ABx=Cx $$ stands for any $$ x $$ . But once $$ AB \neq C $$, the equality between $$ ABx $$ and $$ Cx $$ fully depends on the choosen of the vector $$ x $$.

Suppose this auxiliary vector $$ x $$ is choosen randomly from 0-1 vectors. In other words, each dimension value of $$ x $$ is decided by flipping a coin - head means 1 and tail means 0.
