## Typed Lambda Calculus with Stores

 We will give a denotational semantics for $\text{while}$ programs using a typed lambda calculus with locations and stores, which we interpret over CPOs. 
 
 The lambda calculus we use, which resembles PCF with locations and stores added, will be refered to as $\lambda^{store,fix,\to}$. This calculus has type constants $val$, $bool$, $loc$, $store$, and $store_{\perp}$, with the first four interpreted as in the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. The difference between $store$ and $store_{\perp}$ is that the latter will have an added least element, $\perp_{store}$. 

 In addition to function symbols from the signature $\Sigma$, giving functions on $val$ and $bool$, the calculus $\lambda^{store,fix,\to}$ has an equality test 

 $$\phantom{\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}}Eq?:loc \to loc \to bool$$

on locations, store operations $init$, $update$ and $lookup$, a conditional $\text{if } ... \text{ then } ... \text{ else }...$ of each type. as in PCF, lifting operations (described below), lambda abstraction, application, and a fixed-point operator $fix_{store}$ of type

$$fix_{store}:((store \to store_\perp) \to (store \to store_\perp)) \to (store \to store_\perp).$$

This will be used to define functions from $store$ to $store_\perp$ recursively.

The CPO model, $\mathcal{A}_\lambda$, for $\lambda^{store,fix,\to}$ will be an extension of the four-sorted algebra, $\mathcal{A}$, that was constructed by extending $\mathcal{A}_0$ with locations and stores.

Since any set may be regarded as a discrete CPO, we may continue to interpret $val$, $bool$, $loc$ and $store$ as in $\mathcal{A}$.
