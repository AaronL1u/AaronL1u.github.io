## Typed Lambda Calculus with Stores

 We will give a denotational semantics for $\text{while}$ programs using a typed lambda calculus with locations and stores, which we interpret over CPOs. 
 
 The lambda calculus we use, which resembles PCF with locations and stores added, will be refered to as $\lambda^{store,fix,\to}$. This calculus has type constants $val$, $bool$, $loc$, $store$, and $store_{\perp}$, with the first four interpreted as in the algebra $\mathcal{A}$
