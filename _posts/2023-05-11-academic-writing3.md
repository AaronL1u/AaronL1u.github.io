## Revising Your Draft

Some new researchers think that once they have a draft, they're pratically done. Experienced researchers know better. They write that first draft not for their readers but for themselves, to see whether they can present rigorous written reasoning. Then they revise until they think their draft meets the needs and expectations of their readers. That's hard, because we all know our own work too well to read it as others will. To revise effectively, you must know what readers look for and whether your draft helps them find it. To that end, there are some mechanical steps that may help you analyze your draft objectively.


### Good Practice

A good practice is to first revising overall organization, especially the "outer frame" of the introduction and conclusion; then sections, paragraphs, sentences; and finally stylistic issues such as spelling and punctuation (see another [post]({% post_url 2023-05-08-academic-writing2 %})). This is the exact order the reader reads your paper.

Many experienced researchers find that they can edit hard copy more reliably than they can edit text on a screen. Even if you prefer to edit on a screen, consider reading it at once printed version. You may catch more errors, and you'll get a better sense of your paper's overall structure than you can from the screen alone.


### Check for Blind Spots in Your Argument

After the first draft, parts of your argument will likely still not stand up to a robust challenge. So before you spend too much time polishing sentences, check your argument's reasoning. Have you considered the strongest relevant counterarguments? Have you looked for evidence that challenges or complicates your evidence? Have you considered alternative interpretations of your evidence? If not, now is the time. It's always helpful to talk with your instructor or friends about where your argument overlooks likely objections.


### Make Sure the Body of Your Paper is Coherent

Here are two key questions you can ask to make sure the coherence of the paper body.

1. Do key terms run through your whole paper?

- Circle key terms in the claim as stated in your introduction and conclusion.
- Cicle those same terms in the body of your paper.
- Underline other words related to concepts named by those circled terms.

If reader don't see at least one of your key terms in most paragraphs, they may think your paper wanders. If you underlined many more words than you circled, be sure that readers will recognize how the underlined words relate to the concepts named in your circled key terms. If readers might miss the connection, change some of those related words to the key terms.


2. Is it clear how each section relates to the whole?

For each section, ask, *What question does this section answer?* If it doesn't help to answer questions whose answers constitue an argument, think about its relevance: does it create a context, explain a background concept or issue, or help readers in some other way? If you can't explain how a section relates to your claim, consider cutting it.
