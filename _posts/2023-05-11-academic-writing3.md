## Revising Your Draft

Some new researchers think that once they have a draft, they're pratically done. Experienced researchers know better. They write that first draft not for their readers but for themselves, to see whether they can present rigorous written reasoning. Then they revise until they think their draft meets the needs and expectations of their readers. That's hard, because we all know our own work too well to read it as others will. To revise effectively, you must know what readers look for and whether your draft helps them find it. To that end, there are some mechanical steps that may help you analyze your draft objectively.


### Good Practice

A good practice is to first revising overall organization, especially the "outer frame" of the introduction and conclusion; then sections, paragraphs, sentences; and finally stylistic issues such as spelling and punctuation (see another [post]({% post_url 2023-05-08-academic-writing2 %})). This is the exact order the reader reads your paper.

Many experienced researchers find that they can edit hard copy more reliably than they can edit text on a screen. Even if you prefer to edit on a screen, consider reading it at once printed version. You may catch more errors, and you'll get a better sense of your paper's overall structure than you can from the screen alone.
