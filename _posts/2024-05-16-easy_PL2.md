## Induction on Proofs

A **Hilbert-style proof system** consists of axioms and proof rules. An **axiom** of a proof system is a formula that is provable by definition. An **inference rule** asserts that if some list of formula is provable, then another formula is also provable. A **proof**, therefore, is a structured object built from formulas according to constraints established by a set of axioms and inference rules. 

These definitions may seem obscure at first glance. Now let's take a closer look about this proof system.

Axioms and inference rules are generally written as **schemes**, representing all formulas or proof steps in a given form.
We start from the most basic axiom scheme — the reflexivity axiom for equality.

$$e=e \tag*{(ref)}$$

This axiom scheme asserts that every equation of the form $$e=e$$ is an axiom. For example, $$x = x$$, $$y=y$$, and $$3=3$$ axioms under this scheme.

An inference rule scheme generally has the form

$$\frac{A_1 \: A_2 \:...\:A_n}{B}$$

meaning that if we have proofs of formulas of the form $$A_1$$, $$A_2$$, and $$A_n$$, then we can combine these proofs to obtain a proof of the corresponding formula $$B$$.

For example, the inference rule for transitivity of equality is written

$$\frac{e_1 = e_2 \quad e_2 = e_3}{e_1=e_3} \tag*{(trans)}$$

This means that if we have a proof of $$3+5=8$$ and a proof of $$8 = 2^3$$, then we can combine these two proofs to form a proof of the equation $$3+5 = 2^3$$.

Technically, the formulas above the horizontal line are called **antecedents** of the proof rule, and the formula below the line are called the  **consequence**.
