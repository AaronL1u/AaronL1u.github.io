## Fixed Points and the Full Continuous Hierarchy

Our current motivation for studying domain-theoretic models is to construct Henkin models  of typed lambda calculi with fixed-point operators.

The type frame, $\mathcal{A}$, called the **full continuous** $\lambda^{\times, \to}$ **hierarchy over** CPOs $\langle A^{b_0} ,\leq_0 \rangle , ... , \langle A^{b_k} ,\leq_k \rangle$ is defined by taking $A^{b_0}, ..., A^{b_k}$ as base types, and

$$
\begin{split}
&A^{\sigma \times \tau} = A^{\sigma} \times A^{\tau} \\
&A^{\sigma \to \tau} = \text{ all continuous } f: \langle A^{\sigma} ,\leq_\sigma \rangle \to \langle A^{\tau} ,\leq_\tau \rangle
\end{split}
$$

with $A^{\sigma \times \tau}$ ordered coordinate-wise by $\leq_{\sigma \times \tau}$ and $A^{\sigma \to \tau}$ ordered point-wise by $\leq_{\sigma \to \tau}$. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 4 in the last article, each $\langle A^{\sigma} ,\leq_\sigma \rangle$ is a CPO.

The main result of this section is that the full continuous type hierarchy over any CPOs forms a Henkin model, with least-fixed-point operators at all pointed types. Before proving that the full continuous hierarchy is a Henkin model, we consider the interpretation of $fix$.

We say $a$ is a **least fixed point** of $f$ if $a = f(a)$ and, whenever $b = f(b)$, we have $a \leq b$.

**(Lemma 1.)** If $\mathcal{D}$ is a pointed CPO, and $f:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}$ is continuous, then $f$ has a least fixed point

$$ fix_D \: f = \bigvee \{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}.$$

In addition, the map $fix_D$ is a continuous function.

> This lemma says that we can find the least fixed point of any function $f$ by repreatedly applying $f$ to the least element of its domain.

**(Proof.)** Let $f:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}$ be continuous. Since $f$ is monotonic, and $\perp \leq f(\perp)$, we can see that $f^n(\perp) \leq f^{n+1}(\perp)$. It follows that $$ \{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}$$ is linearly ordered and therefore directed. Let $a$ be the least upper bound $$a = \bigvee \{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}$$.

We must show that $a$ is a fixed point of $f$. By continuity of $f$,

$$
\begin{split}
f(a) &= f(\bigvee \{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \})\\
&= \bigvee \{ f^{n+1}(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}.
\end{split}
$$

Since $$\{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}$$ and $$\{ f^{n+1}(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}$$ have the same least upper bound, we have $f(a) = a$.

To see that $a$ is the least fixed point of $f$, suppose $b = f(b)$ is any fixed point. Since $\perp \leq b$, we have $f(\perp) \leq f(b)$ and similarly $f^n(\perp) \leq f^n(b)$ for any $n \geq 0$. But since $b$ is a fixed point of $f$, $f^n(b) = b$. Therefore $b$ is an upper bound for the set $$\{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}$$. Since the least upper bound of this set is $a$, it follows that $a \leq b$.

The final step is to show that the function $fix_D$ mapping $f$ to $$\{ f^n(\perp)\}$$ is itself continuous. Let us suppose that $S \subseteq D \to D$ is directed, with $\bigvee S = f$. We must show that $$fix_D \: f = \bigvee \{ fix_D \: g \mid g \in S \}$$. By continuity of function application, each $f^n(\perp)$ is the least upper bound of the set of all $g^n(\perp)$ with $g \in S$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{split}
fix_D \: f &= \bigvee \{ f^n(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 \}\\
&= \bigvee \{ g^{n}(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 ,\: g \in S \}.
\end{split}
$$

It is easy to see that $$\{ g^{n}(\perp) \mid n \geq 0 ,\: g \in S \}$$ and $$\{ fix_D \: g \mid g \in S \}$$ have the same least upper bound, since any upper bound for the $g^n(\perp)$'s must be an upper bound for the $$(fix_D \: g)$$'s. Therefore,


$$
fix_D \: f = \bigvee \{ fix_D \: g \mid g \in S \}.
$$

This proves the lemma. $\blacksquare$
